# Kayke Barbosa

I'm a Software Engineer with around 2 years of experience in full-stack development, working with technologies like HTML, CSS, JS, TS, Node.js, ReactJS, React Native, Python, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and more.

I focus on building efficient, scalable solutions with intuitive interfaces. I'm always improving my skills, exploring areas like cloud computing, microservices, and automation to solve real-world challenges.

Currently, I work as a web developer and I'm looking for opportunities to collaborate with innovative teams and contribute with my technical experience and passion for development.
